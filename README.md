Graphics Lab
=============================

Week 6 lab - Graphics, Animation, Touch, and Multi-Media. This weeks lab involved creating bubbles on a screen that could then be "flung" or popped via touch. When they are popped they create a pop sound as well. The bubbles are Bitmap objects, and threads are used to draw them with random sizes, rotations, and velocities. 

A `GestureDetector` is used for the different touch actions.

The `BubbleView` class handles most of the properties and drawing of the bubbles.
